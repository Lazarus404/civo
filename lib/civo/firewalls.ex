defmodule Civo.Firewalls do
  @moduledoc """
  The simplest solution for most customers is to configure a firewall within 
  their Instances using either iptables which is powerful or Uncomplicated 
  Firewall/ufw which is much simpler but only works on Ubuntu.

  As an another option, customers can configure custom firewall rules for 
  their instances using the Firewall API which adjusts the security group 
  for your network of instances. These are a freely configurable option, 
  however customers should be careful to not lock out their access to the 
  instances.

  This API is effectively split in to two parts: 1) Managing firewalls 
  themselves, and 2) Managing rules within those firewalls.

  Create a firewall for an account.

  Any user can create firewalls for their network of instances,

  There are no URL parameters and only one POST parameter
